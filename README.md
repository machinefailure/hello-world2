# hello-world2
jest to let me learn more to benefit my life and make myself excellent.
Hello, everyone.

Here,
 I will store some things about programming learning.
 I am a beginner, so my storage may seem childish. 
 I want to reach your altitude, although I am making slow progress.
 Because I have to spend most of my time studying to go to the ideal university, 
 and my plan is not limited to this.  
 Therefore it is normal for me not to be online for a long time, 
 and I can only guarantee that I will log in to github every week. 
 But rest assured, I will never give up,
 I believe I can learn better ï¼Œ
 I believe I can reach the height I want. 
 Now, be my own, this is enough.
